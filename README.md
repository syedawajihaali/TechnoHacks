Task 1: Calculator

1.	Objective: Create a basic calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
2.	Description: Devised an intelligent calculator capable of executing elementary mathematical operations. Users have the flexibility to select from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring precise and accurate outcomes even for intricate computations.
3.	Key Features:
o	Supports diverse arithmetic operations.
o	Manages scenarios involving division by zero.
o	Intuitive interface for user-friendly interaction.
4.	Implementation: Employed distinct functions for each operation and solicited user input for operands and the chosen operation.
   
Task 2: Simple To-Do List

1.	Objective: Build a program that allows user to add, remove, and view items on a to-do list.
2.	Description: Crafted an intuitive and efficient tool for managing tasks. Users can append, delete, and view tasks in an organized manner. The application fosters organization and productivity by furnishing a clear overview of completed tasks.
3.	Key Features:
o	Effortlessly append and remove tasks.
o	Display tasks added during the current session.
o	Mark tasks as completed.
o	Streamlined and user-friendly interface.
4.	Implementation: Established a ToDoList class equipped with methods for task management, complemented by an accessible menu for user interaction.
   
Task 3: Random Password Generator

1.	Objective: Create a program that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria (e.g., length, complexity).
2.	Description: Formulated a robust Password Generator that crafts distinct passwords. Users input their desired password length and complexity (whether they want their password to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits and/or special characters) and the generator intelligently blends letters, numerals, and special characters to establish random passwords.
3.	Key Features:
o	Configurable password length.
o	Desired complexity of passwords
o	Simple and user-friendly interface.
4.	Implementation: Employed the string module to define character sets and harnessed the random library to randomly select characters, guided by user input.
   
Collectively, these assignments showcase adept Java programming skills and underscore the capability to develop operational and user-centric applications. The code for each task is meticulously structured, harnessing libraries and Java's built-in functionalities to optimum effect.
